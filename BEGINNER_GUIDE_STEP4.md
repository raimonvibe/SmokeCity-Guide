# ðŸš€ Step 4: Production Deployment & Performance Optimization

**First, prepare your app for production by reviewing the `render-deploy-instructions.md` file and setting up a free Render account, then configure the deployment using the provided `render.yaml` file which includes build commands, environment variables, and production settings.** **Next, deploy your SmokeCity backend to Render by connecting your GitHub repository, adding the required ACRCloud environment variables (ACRCLOUD_HOST, ACRCLOUD_ACCESS_KEY, ACRCLOUD_ACCESS_SECRET) plus NODE_ENV=production in the Render dashboard.** **Finally, test your live deployment by accessing the Render service URL, navigating to `/play.html`, and verifying that audio recognition works in production with proper error handling and performance monitoring as outlined in the testing deployment diagrams.**

*This completes the full development cycle from Steps 1-3 - your SmokeCity app is now production-ready!*
